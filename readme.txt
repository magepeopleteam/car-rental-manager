== Guideline ==
Shortcode:
`
[mpcrbm_booking form='inline' progressbar='no']
`
This is a simple shortcode that will display only the search form, similar to our homepage

`
[mpcrbm_booking form='inline' title='yes' progressbar='no' search_result='yes' ajax_search='yes']
`

This is a shortcode that you will decide when the title will show or not. If title=no, then the search form title bar will not show, and if search_result='yes' then the  default search result will show with form, and if ajax_search='yes' then the  search result will show as ajax, not a redirection.
This shortcode will show the form as an inline form, and  it can also be a  horizontal form, and the progressbar can be yes or no

`
[mpcrbm_booking form='horizontal' progressbar='no']
`
and also 
`
[mpcrbm_car_list mpcrbm_left_filter='yes' style='grid' show='6' ]
`
This is a shortcode to display the car list with a left filter.
